I like to think of myself as a visual crusader for a better world. My aim, through my work, is to bring visibility to positive products, ideas &amp; concepts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What materials and techniques do you use?<\/strong><br \/>\nThe majority of my work is best described as modern still life captured through a camera. This means that regardless of the subject or objective, my work usually involves: hero objects; support objects\/items (called props); a designed set; lighting; a camera; and a digital post-production process. My set and support props vary a lot from project to project. Paper, card, timber, laminate &amp; tile are often featuring in my set design, as well as other materials such as glass, cork and fabric. My most often used props include plants, stones and food items.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Karina-x-Play-1.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1067\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>What kind of inspirations go into your work?<br \/>\nI am hugely inspired by the notion of telling a story or delivering a message through a visual medium. I enjoy selecting the exact combinations of colours, tones, light, shadow, composition, complexity, mood &amp; drama that help to convey specific visual narratives.&nbsp;Artistically, I create from a desire to make the mind smile. My artistic work is most strongly influenced by the natural world and botanical studies, which I am currently merging with modern styles and influences from other industries, such as fashion, science and still life editorial. The juxtaposition of human life and nature is also of particular interest to me, as are the concepts of reality, time and perception. To me, nothing much is ordinary.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/SweetKicks-2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"960\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nI always create in the studio. For the last few years I have worked out of my home studio while my children were young, in the room between the living area and the bedrooms. But now that I have outgrown that space I am getting ready to move into a studio outside of the house, and within the new creative space located in Caloundra\u2019s sub-terrarium bus station: Sub Tropic Studio.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Plant-Power-2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1086\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nBasically, I love almost everything I work on, but if I had to pick there project I would pick these ones:<\/p>\n<p>1. My \u201cPlant Power\u201d series for online plant publication The Planthunter. A series of conceptual plant art images created to explore the notion of plants as objects; as if we could attempt to measure their absoluteness. I am choosing this project because it was self-led, challenging, and one of the first times I pursued a creative hunch to such a prominent level.<\/p>\n<p>2. My series for Surfstitch called \u201cSweet Kicks\u201d. A series of campaign images to showcase the colours of their footwear by matching them to iconic &amp; nostalgic lollies. I am choosing this project also because it was an immense challenge, but also because it was one of those special times that self-exploratory work led to amazing commercial opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>3. My work for Mukti Organics. Mukti is one of my favourite clients. Their dedication to non-toxic, natural and ethical skincare is super impressive and I am so proud to help bring visibility to their products and ethos.<\/p>\n<p>To see more of Karina&#8217;s work, head to her <a href=\"https:\/\/karinasharpe.com.au\/\">website <\/a>or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/karina_jean_sharpe\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Karina-Sharpe-July2019.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Who are you and what do you create?<\/strong><br \/>\nI\u2019m Karina Sharpe and I creative conceptual imagery for purposeful brands and meaningful endeavours.
