They mix easy, remove and add with water and other mediums too which really opens up a platform for my creative exploration process which is often quick, intense and expressive.<\/p>\n<p>As far as techniques, I favour layering &#8211; this creates so much depth to me and also adds unexpected surprises and textures you wouldn&#8217;t normally achieve by painting a flat image on canvas. Normally I begin with a watered down wash, using towels and rags to create depth and texture, before adding patterns and colours and finishing finally as an abstract work or overlaying with a subject matter. It&#8217;s also interesting to me to paint over old work &#8211; again finding unexpected textures and compositions I wouldn&#8217;t have achieved without the other painting underneath.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/LoveFromLight-98.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1152\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What kind of inspirations go into your work?<br \/>\nI paint what I feel. My emotional responses to a place, a person, my own internal journey. I often say that you can tell what&#8217;s going on for me in my life by looking at my work. Often exploring concepts in polarity, I love to pair and contrast masculine and feminine energies. Coupled with an overwhelming love for nature and the beautiful place that I call home, it lands me somewhere in the middle of internal and externals worlds combined on canvas.<\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nI have a beautiful little home studio that I whipped up in my rental property&#8217;s double garage. Here I have been able to create some of my most favourite pieces, along with all the work for my first solo and group shows. I like to practice ritual in my space before getting to work &#8211; my ritual looks a little something like:<\/p>\n<p>Open all the doors, let the fresh air clear out the space<br \/>\nBurn sage or palo santo<br \/>\nLight my candle (studio always have to have a candle and nice smells!)<br \/>\nMusic on!<br \/>\nTidy up work space and prep jars with water and then<br \/>\nMAKE!<\/p>\n<p>As well as this, I adore packing a sketchpad and some paints and painting out in the sun at the beach, using the salt water to paint also creates unexpected results which I think is so interesting and inspiring (along with geo-stamping the location by using the locations own materials, this is my favourite thing about painting with wild waters &#8211; the sense of a place is all but woven into the piece, how magical!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/artist-photo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nThere are 3 pieces in particular which are my all time favs &#8211; and come to think of it, all have a similar colour palettes and themes, but made at 3 different times and for 3 different reasons!<\/p>\n<p>Sentiments d&#8217;eau profonde<\/p>\n<p>Which means &#8216;deep water feelings&#8217;. This piece was the first of its kind, and the first time I ever saw one of my pieces with a frame. I remember feeling so proud and excited seeing a frame on this, I felt like the real deal. This piece stayed with me and still hangs in my room proudly.<\/p>\n<p>Eden<\/p>\n<p>Something special I made for someone, this piece was something I&#8217;d never done before. It pushed me so far from my usual comforts and in return developed into one of my favourite pieces. It is a painting of water, from a local beach, painted with the saltwater from that beach. Given as a gift, this piece was a game changer for me in proving to myself that I had not only creative skills, but also technical ability to create anything I could imagine<\/p>\n<p>Mer<\/p>\n<p>One of the pieces from my first solo show and the first of them to sell, this big beauty celebrated a combination of the sea, whale sharks and the bubbles blown from whales and dolphins (I think you can see my ocean influences coming through now). This was a crowd favourite amongst us all at the shows and sold to such a perfect couple who love her and have given her a new life in a beautiful home! This means a lot to me, my paintings are my babies and seeing the joy they bring to others is something I will cherish forever.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/EDEW-lily1-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/EDEWART-49.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/EDEW-sable-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To see more of Ebony&#8217;s work, head to her <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/e__dew\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Who are you and what do you create?<\/strong><br \/>\nI am Ebony and I paint!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>What materials and techniques do you use?<\/strong><br \/>\nI have a big love for poly-cotton blend canvas&#8217; &#8211; the larger the better!<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4244,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_editorskit_title_hidden":false,"_editorskit_reading_time":0,"_editorskit_is_block_options_detached":false,"_editorskit_block_options_position":"{}","inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[64],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/812"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=812"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/812\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4243,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/812\/revisions\/4243"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4244"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=812"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=812"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=812"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
