I guess you could call me free spirited yet very organised. I love to create, whether it be cooking, painting, knitting, sewing etc. It&#8217;s what makes my heart warm inside. This chapter of my life, I am doing what I love most; pottery. At the moment I am experimenting with new shapes and forms, connecting deeper to Mother Earth and her natural flows and formations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/B8E800C6-2324-4665-88ED-8081C8E3DA92.jpeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1152\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>What materials and techniques do you use?<br \/>\nThe materials I use are constantly changing. I like to try new clay bodies and glazes to keep the look of my business new and refreshing. Although I do have my favourites. I always use a simple white raku clay and a dark stoneware clay, they are so nice to use especially for beginners. The main glazes I use are very warm and subtle tones, perfect for any home setting.<\/p>\n<p>What kind of inspirations go into your work?<br \/>\nI am eternally inspired by formations from my natural environments and always drawn to the ebb and flow of native Australian trees.&nbsp;I also find inspiration from like-minded and very talented artists and friends.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/561561A2-5D17-43E7-93D9-0A7CF064B77E.jpeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"957\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/9593820E-CA52-4DA4-859F-3BD74176FC80.jpeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"903\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nI am currently creating at home on my balcony which I really enjoy. I feel like I get to enjoy nature and the sunshine and still be able to create at the same time. Oh and also having easy access to my fridge hehe. Eventually I would love to have my own studio but for now I am content.<\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nMy most important work so far would have to be the UFO vase. I was brought up watching documentaries and hearing stories about mysteries beyond this earth, so I thought of my dad straight away when I created it and knew how excited he would be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To see more of Jedda&#8217;s work, head to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jeddaclay.com\/\">website&nbsp;<\/a>or&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jeddaclay\/\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/9C2146EE-9F3C-4DCD-BD44-ACB0FF765B75_0.jpeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Who are you and what do you create?<\/strong><br \/>\nMy name is Jedda and I am based on the Sunshine Coast.
