A torrential prayer to the beauty and devastation of entanglement.<\/p>\n<p>Once registered, you will be sent a series of written invitations and four audio tracks.<\/p>\n<p>________________________________________________________________<\/p>\n<p>Creator x Writer&nbsp;| Ruby Donohoe<\/p>\n<p>Sound Design&nbsp;| Isha Simpson<\/p>\n<p>________________________________________________________________<\/p>\n<p>This audio journey is a translation of the creative development of the dance-theatre work devised as part of Horizon Festival\u2019s 2021 Homegrown Program. Inspired by the conversations, the rituals discovered, and the energies of our collective and individual searching bodies, this work invites audiences to get to know the spirit behind&nbsp;LUNG WATER&nbsp;in a deeply personal way. LUNG WATER was born in collaboration with Jenni Large, Giema Contini, Eleonora Ginardi, Jorge Serra, Isha Simpson, and Estefania Nurit.<\/p>\n<p>________________________________________________________________<\/p>\n<p>LUNG WATER (Audio Journey)<\/p>\n<h2>REGISTRATIONS CLOSE FRIDAY 18 FEBRUARY, 2022.<\/h2>\n<p>Part One&nbsp;| Solo Journey Anytime prior to Friday 18 February, 2022<\/p>\n<p>Part Two&nbsp;| Solo Journey Anytime on Friday 18 February, 2022<\/p>\n<p>Part Three&nbsp;| Collective Gathering 6.30pm Sunday 20 February, 2022 (Chambers Island, Bradman Ave.)<\/p>\n<p>Part Four&nbsp;| Solo Journey Anytime after the Collective Gathering (Sunday 20 February, 6.30pm)<\/p>\n<p>________________________________________________________________<\/p>\n<h2>ACCESS<\/h2>\n<p>Please contact Ruby directly at <a href=\"mailto:ruby.donohoe@gmail.com\">ruby.donohoe@gmail.com<\/a> for more information about access or to discuss access options.
