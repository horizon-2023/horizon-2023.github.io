My most recent projects have all sat under the umbrella of my long-term venture&nbsp;The League for Human Integrity, launched in Berlin, 2018.&nbsp;In response to a global mood of disillusion prompted by right-wing power swings, climate change, and corporatisation, the project aspires to \u2018ideological reinvention in the age of Mass Consumerism\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>As far as projects go,&nbsp;Integrity&nbsp;endeavours to paramount social transformation, a prerequisite of all movements.&nbsp;During the research for this project I looked at past ideological movements, but I was also looking for a structure in nature that might represent the idea of a connected humanity.&nbsp;As a profuse drawer of living organisms, and the founder of the movement The German Monist League, Ernst Haeckel popped up on my radar more than once.&nbsp;Haeckel was a nature scientist during the turn of the twentieth century, and it was one of his observational drawings of a protist that inspired the insignia for&nbsp;Integrity.&nbsp;His philosophy that&nbsp;every organism was important to the whole&nbsp;was also an enlightening metaphor that resonated with&nbsp;Integrity\u2019s&nbsp;ambition for human equity, and the significance of each individual and creature that shares our Earth.&nbsp;In this way you can imagine that every individual plays a role in the health of the planet.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/IMG_7202.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>What are five words you would use to describe live art to someone unfamiliar with the art form?<br \/>\nResponsive<br \/>\nKinetic<br \/>\nSpacial<br \/>\nEvocative<br \/>\nConnective<\/p>\n<p>What excites you most about your Seedpod Pilot residency?<br \/>\nHow to create compelling work that effectively communicates your ideas and intrigues audiences?&nbsp;Working in isolation most definitely impedes these aspects of creative development. What excites me most about the Seedpod Pilot residency is the critical and engaging framework it offers.<\/p>\n<p>Situated in the now defunct Maroochydore Courthouse Lock-up, my residency will be adjacent to a scenic, but urban thoroughfare, allowing a direct link for public connection.&nbsp; To maximise this opportunity I will invite the opinions of passers-by on the topics that my project explores, and establish a meaningful dialogue with them.&nbsp;The Lock-up is also the space where I will be testing the outcomes of my residency through two public performances in February.&nbsp;It is an intimate space with a history of human experience seared into the very fabric of the building, an atmosphere that will introduce another layer to the work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Most vitally, I will be working with a dynamic team who will be supporting my project on so many levels.&nbsp; I am particularly looking forward to the critical conversation that I will share with Jude Anderson, my mentor. Jude is an aspirational figure for what I desire for my own practice.&nbsp;I know that in her hands I will be safe in being challenged to disengage from the traditional boundaries of arts practice.<\/p>\n<p>A recent shift from presenting work in the gallery to activating public spaces has also complicated the organisational aspects of my projects, creating the need for new skills and knowledge.&nbsp;In this way the production support of the Horizon Festival team will free the project to grow organically, and reach its full potential as the transformative work I anticipate it to be.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Berlin-ritual-image.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"702\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Who are you and what do you create?<\/strong><br \/>\nI am an artist who creates social projects and transformative experiences.
