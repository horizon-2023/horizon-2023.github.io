I\u2019ve been a writer, a performer, a poet, a songwriter, a dancer, a wannabe singer and a sexy bitch. You might have seen me on ABC\u2019s <em>Black Comedy<\/em>, or hosting SBS\u2019s <em>Faborginal<\/em>, or even in the documentary<em> Looky Looky Here Comes Cooky<\/em>, but my work on television is only a small part of me \u2014 you get to see a lot more of me in my show!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I\u2019d love to hear about life when you were younger. Where did you grow up?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m from a small town in North West Queensland called Cloncurry,&nbsp;population about 2500, and that&#8217;s where my&nbsp;performing started. I was 5 years old in the backyard of my grandparent&#8217;s house and&nbsp;whenever there were family barbecues or parties going on&nbsp;they would&nbsp;always get me to put on a&nbsp;little dance show to&nbsp;entertain everyone.&nbsp;Then I moved to Townsville to go to school and danced my way through there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have you always been&nbsp;<em>funny<\/em>? Or is it something you had worked towards?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think my family has always been funny and I just&nbsp;think Blackfellas in general are funny \u2014 it must be in the blood.&nbsp;And being gay is a big part of that too. From being part of the gay community, to watching drag shows and being a simple bitch sometimes,&nbsp;we\u2019re always making each other&nbsp;laugh. Even just being an Australian in general,&nbsp;there\u2019s a specific sense of humour we all share and its all&nbsp;mixed up in there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Before the life you now live, what were you doing?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve always performed,&nbsp;but, that being said, I\u2019ve worked a few odd jobs too. I&#8217;ve worked at a Telstra shop and also as a receptionist at the Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Legal Service. If you ever saw my sketch&nbsp;\u2018Black on Track\u2019 on <em>Black Comedy<\/em>, it all came from&nbsp;working&nbsp;at that call centre and pretty much is all true lol.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bb-3website-hero.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2979\" srcset=\"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bb-3website-hero.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bb-3website-hero-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bb-3website-hero-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bb-3website-hero-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bb-3website-hero-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bb-3website-hero-800x450.jpg 800w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bb-3website-hero-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bb-3website-hero-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><figcaption>Image credit: Dylan Evans Photography<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deep down, are you the same person from all those years ago?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes and no. I think deep&nbsp;down&nbsp;there\u2019s a spirit you have as a person that stays the same but the way you&nbsp;perceive the world can&nbsp;definitely change. For example, when I was younger my two least favourite Michael Jackson songs were <em>Man in the&nbsp;Mirror<\/em> and&nbsp;<em>Human Nature <\/em>and now that I\u2019m&nbsp;older they\u2019re&nbsp;actually my two favourite songs. I think that comes from life&nbsp;experience and becoming a bit more humble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Comedy is always going to be subjective. Do you have a team you bounce your jokes and ideas off? Or are you flying solo?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I fly solo.&nbsp;Definitely when I\u2019m&nbsp;hanging out with friends I\u2019ll come up with some stupid stuff and get a laugh and then I\u2019ll think&nbsp;\u2018ooh I\u2019ll use that!\u2019&nbsp;But I don\u2019t have a&nbsp;team. Pretty sure that only happens in Hollywood.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Was there a defining moment in your life, when you knew you were on the right path?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I&nbsp;think I\u2019ve&nbsp;always had a strong&nbsp;instinct for being a storyteller and a&nbsp;performer. I strongly&nbsp;believe that when you have moments of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, that\u2019s a sign you are on the right track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the worst thing about being Steven Oliver?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The worst thing is being a dramatic bitch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the best thing about being Steven Oliver?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best thing is being a <em>sexy <\/em>dramatic bitch<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/bb-website-hero.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1872\" srcset=\"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/bb-website-hero.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/bb-website-hero-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/bb-website-hero-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/bb-website-hero-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/bb-website-hero-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/bb-website-hero-800x450.jpg 800w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/bb-website-hero-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/bb-website-hero-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><figcaption>Image credit: Dylan Evans Photography<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-highlight-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Grab a ticket to <em>Steven Oliver: Bigger &amp; Blacker<\/em> <a aria-label=\"here (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/event\/steven-oliver-bigger-blacker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">here<\/a>.<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-primary-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">check out the full program <a href=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/whats-on\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"here (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">here<\/a>.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:14px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>we caught up with the man behind this year&#8217;s show &#8216;Bigger &amp; blacker&#8217;, Steven oliver.
