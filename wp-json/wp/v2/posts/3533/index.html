Firstly, tell us a bit about yourself? What\u2019s your (short) story?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m an artist from Toowoomba. I\u2019ve been writing and releasing music for about 3 years now. I have two cats and a dog!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Has music always been a big part of your life? What are some of your earliest musical memories?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of my family members around me were musicians growing up, so music was a really massive part of my life, for most of my life. My earliest music memories are being backstage trying to go to sleep next to massive PA systems thumping through the floor while mum and dad played their set.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What made you head down this career path? Was there a defining moment where you thought this is what you wanted to do?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember always wanting to be a singer and be on stage like my mum, but I would never sing. One day I was in my room singing to myself and my mum overheard \u2014 she called my grandad (who worked in the music industry at the time) and told him to come over. When he arrived, she told me to sing that song to him, so I did, and it all kind of grew from there. Grandad and I started to record cover songs and do little live shows around Brisbane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What keeps you busy outside of work? What\u2019s a perfect day?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playing computer games and cuddling with my cats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You\u2019re part of our <em>Open Air Series<\/em>, which celebrates place. It\u2019s too late now (for the festival) but where\u2019s your dream place to play in Australia?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t think it gets much better than a beach on the Sunny Coast, to be honest.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1709\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/CLOE-x-LB-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3548\" srcset=\"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/CLOE-x-LB-scaled.jpg 1709w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/CLOE-x-LB-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/CLOE-x-LB-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/CLOE-x-LB-768x1151.jpg 768w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/CLOE-x-LB-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/CLOE-x-LB-1367x2048.jpg 1367w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/CLOE-x-LB-1568x2349.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1709px) 100vw, 1709px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are you hyped to see at the festival?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m very excited to see <a aria-label=\"Circa's Peepshow (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/event\/circas-peepshow\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Circa&#8217;s Peepshow<\/a> \u2014 I&#8217;m always amazed at the balance and talent in those types of shows, so I wont be missing that one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Where does it go from here?
