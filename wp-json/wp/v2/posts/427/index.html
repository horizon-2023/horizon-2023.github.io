I paint and sculpt oil paintings, but also use other mediums including&nbsp;oil stick, paper, pencil, even peculiar dried-up chunks of paint off the studio floor, that have been trodden on for who knows how long. Dabbling with new mediums &amp; techniques keeps the creative process miles away from the monotonous zone, and&nbsp;it\u2019s always something to look forward to.&nbsp;Whether it works out or not, who cares.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/heroblog_0.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"953\" alt=\"Mitch Cheesman in studio\"><\/p>\n<p>What materials and techniques do you use?<br \/>\nThe main technique&nbsp;I use whilst painting&nbsp;is&nbsp;neo-expressionism. I paint quite fast, scooping blobs of oil paint off one of the many palettes I have around the studio onto the canvas. I really admire the spillages and paint splatters that often occur in this process.&nbsp;It keeps the painting raw, and the mistakes often end up looking more intriguing than a section of the painting that was intentional&nbsp;\u2013 most of the time ending up with a very conceptual piece of work.<\/p>\n<p>What kind of inspirations go into your work?<br \/>\nThe pieces I end up with, are inspired by the music I listen to. I listen to a lot of Miles, Coltrane &amp; Bill Evans, and certain songs go hand in hand with my painting \u2013 maybe it\u2019s the same stroke I make on the canvas with my palette knife. Other sources of inspiration are my surroundings, like things I might take in walking down a street, or drawing new ideas with pencil &amp; paper. And of course, other artists, past &amp; present, always get me out of bed in the morning.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/1_4.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" alt=\"Mitch Cheesman paintings on the ground\"><\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nMy favourite place for my ideas to spill out would have to be at home on my old couch, maybe listening to some instruments come together, and scribbling lines on paper.<\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nMy most important work is always the most recent, because that\u2019s where you\u2019re at \u2013 you aren\u2019t any more advanced than what you\u2019re creating in that given moment. With the exception of a collage piece I did a few months ago for artist, Ray Johnson\u2019s 26th Anniversary since his passing. That piece was definitely a deep body of work I&#8217;ve done&nbsp;throughout my career. He was a collagist from New York.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/3_2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1061\" alt=\"Mitch Cheesman painting on the wall\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/2_3.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" alt=\"Mitch Cheesman painting on the floor\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/4_2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"826\" alt=\"Mitch Cheesman painting on the wall\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/5_2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"514\" alt=\"Mitch Cheesman black and white painting\"><\/p>\n<p>To see more of Mitch&#8217;s&nbsp;work, head across to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/mitchcheesman\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/6_2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" alt=\"Mitch Cheesman painting\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Who are you and what do you create?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m\u00a0Mitchell Luke Cheesman, 21, born in Brisbane but I now reside in Kawana, Sunshine Coast.
