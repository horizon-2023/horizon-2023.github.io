For two weeks, artist <a href=\"https:\/\/www.biancatainsh.com\/\">Bianca Tainsh<\/a> worked under the mentorship of Jude Anderson, navigating&nbsp;the cultural landscape of the Sunshine Coast, searching for&nbsp;Integrity. Bianca shared her experience of the residency with us..&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>A Commitment to Process and Life Practice<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Investigative process is always fundamental to my projects. To me it\u2019s more than a developmental pursuit. It\u2019s art in action, whether it\u2019s experimenting in my studio, on the net gathering research material for a project archive, or on the streets collecting the thoughts of individuals &#8211; it is art happening. When I\u2019m in this mode I am enacting a role or a persona of sorts. And since the initiation of a long-term project in the form of an ideological initiative of which I am the protagonist and paragon, my art and life practice are becoming increasingly symbiotic.<\/p>\n<p>My Seedpod project brought this to a whole new level, and it has felt like I have taken the leap that was needed, but had been hesitating to make. It\u2019s amazing what can happen in two weeks, especially with a mentor like Jude Anderson who is astute on finding the crux of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s concept and prompting a plan to action. In my two weeks I embarked on a journey of ambitiously connecting with people, inviting them to self-reflect, interact, join a dialogue, and even unite as a membership within the project. To do this I had to jump the hurdle of self-doubt and embrace my role as protagonist. And, being able to \u2018get on with it\u2019 has also paved the way for real discipline in my art-life practice. As First Member of my initiative The League for Human Integrity I have principles to practice through my art, my everyday life, and on a metaphysical level. I have to make lots of things happen and inspire a now growing community of individuals who are invested in what the project is striving for.<\/p>\n<p>On reflection now, I think that the dedicated research process that I carried out in my past projects armed me with the confidence to present works that took bold creative and conceptual leaps. Through this research I would build a store of material to draw from that allowed my works to have multi-layered meanings and divergent perceptual forms. Now it is as though all the investigation that went into those projects has fortified a solid platform for Integrity and my role as First Member. A commitment to research as process has proved to be the most profound impetus in the evolution of my practice to what it is today.<\/p>\n<p>Seedpod was the conduit for this process of realisation. I thank Horizon for facilitating this creative platform, and I thank Jude for being my protagonist when I needed it most.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Seedpod Pilot was\u00a0the first Queensland based residency program from renowned live arts organisation, Punctum,\u00a0presented in collaboration with Horizon Festival, Arts Coast and Creative Spaces.
