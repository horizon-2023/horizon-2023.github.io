I\u2019m a pop artist from Dicky Beach. I paint in a style I refer to as &#8216;pop mash\u2019 where I combine elements from cartoons, comics, products and advertising to create something both foreign and familiar.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/aaron-photo.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>What materials and techniques do you use?<br \/>\nMost of my pieces start as sketches in Photoshop or in Procreate on the iPad Pro. I use these for layout and colour before I start painting so I know what the final piece will look like before I begin painting.&nbsp;I use acrylic paint on either canvas or canvas paper for the majority of my work. I have been known to paint onto salvaged and collected objects like vintage handsaws, sheet music books and match books. My next solo show consists of work painted mostly onto QSL Ham Radio cards from the 1940s-80s.<\/p>\n<p>What kind of inspirations go into your work?<br \/>\nI choose subjects that give me a feeling of nostalgia. I grew up in the 80s \/ 90s so often cartoons \/ toys from that period are represented in my work. The same goes with brands and products from that time. If it was popular in the 80s and 90s the chances are its been featured in my art at some point.<\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nMy \u2019studio\u2019 is actually a big old double garage in my back yard. Ideally I\u2019d love a larger and tidier space but the reality is that I paint from home because I have 2 young boys. Music and a clean studio space are essential!<\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nMy favourite piece is called \u2018Morning Dance\u2019. Its the only painting I have done purely for my family. It features the cartoon theme songs that my 2 boys dance to in the mornings &#8211; Mighty Mouse, Batman, Speed Racer, and Spiderman. It has prime position on the walls in our home.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/POPEYE.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/AARONCRAIG1-web.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"961\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/IMG_7919.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"887\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/fred1-web.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>To see more of Aaron&#8217;s work, head to his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/aaronjcraig\">Instagram <\/a>or <a href=\"https:\/\/stupidkrap.com\/\">website<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Who are you and what do you create?<\/strong><br \/>\nI\u2019m Aaron Craig.
