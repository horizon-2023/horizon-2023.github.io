The exhibition will run from&nbsp;<span>Saturday 23&nbsp;April \u2013&nbsp;July 2, 2022.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong><span>Your upcoming exhibition Mimburi Ninyangurra was originally part of Horizon Festival 2021, but, as we know, was unfortunately postponed. Can you tell us about the exhibition, how it differs from last time (understanding the main works have evolved since then), and what people can expect from it?<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<span>My art is an expression of my continued growth and connection as a Jinibara culture man. Since the original exhibition, that was postponed, I have had huge growth as an artist and a culture man. This has come from spending more time with my ancestral Jinibara country, with my Quandamooka wife and her ancestral country, our families and kin, and navigating our culture within this contemporary world.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This time has been guided by walking country and listening to and singing up country and listening to the language song and knowledge left to me by my ancestor <span>Gaiarbau (Willie McKenzie)&nbsp;<\/span><span> \u2014 an activist of his own time, and a culture man who resisted assimilation and navigated the settler colonial world to ensure the continuation of Jinibara Knowledges.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This exhibition is my Mimburi Ninyangurra \u2014 source of continual dreaming. It is presented with deep gratitude to Gaiarbau and the many others whose footsteps have fought for and tread this path before me. I am hoping this exhibition reflects exactly that. In a nutshell, this exhibition is my dreaming \u2014 it\u2019s generous, it\u2019s raw, it\u2019s deep, it\u2019s personal, and it\u2019s about ongoing connection and sharing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/MN-GAIARBAU-image-3.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1824\" alt=\"First nations elder\"><\/p>\n<p>Image: pictured is BJ&#8217;s&nbsp;ancestor, Gaiarbau (Willie McKenzie)<\/p>\n<p>Country plays an important role in your work from a material and inspiration point of view.
