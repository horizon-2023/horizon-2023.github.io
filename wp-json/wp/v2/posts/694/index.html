Through a shared love of music, a game of pool and telling a good yarn over a cold beer, these events hope to encourage connection between small town locals and the blow-ins from the larger cities,.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What kind of inspirations go into the projects that you work on?<\/strong><br \/>\nI am constantly hitting the road, and most often find inspiration in the quiet long moments on those long highways. It\u2019s something I hope others experience on their trips to OK Motels events.<\/p>\n<p>The current music scene in Melbourne also plays a huge part in inspiring the mood of the events. We\u2019re lucky to have such amazing acts playing round town, and I\u2019m often found dreaming of certain bands playing in far flung places.<\/p>\n<p>Now we are planning the fourth event, we\u2019ve made really strong and beautiful relationships with the people of Charlton, and as each event grows, so does their input into how the event looks and feels. The last event had the most local involvement, and it was by far the most successful and \u2018feel-good\u2019 event so far.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What has been your favourite or most important project(s) to date?<\/strong><br \/>\nI feel OK Motels, will be my most favourite and important, but it is still in its very early stages. The divide between regional Australia and the cities has become so distinct now, we really don\u2019t get each other, and we tend to make assumptions about each other\u2019s lives and beliefs. It would be incredible to be part of a movement who could bridge that gap.<\/p>\n<p>Launching Lunch Lady magazine, in partnership with Louise Bannister and Lara Burke, also was an incredible experience. Creating a brand people love and can connect with has been so humbling. I left Lunch Lady a few years ago now, to spend more time with my family, but it still fills be with joy seeing it on the shelves and connecting with families all over the world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is one piece of advice you\u2019d give to someone looking to realise their creative project?<\/strong><br \/>\nListen and talk to as many people who inspire you as possible, but in the end, <em>always<\/em> listen to yourself. There\u2019ll always be people who have ideas of what your project \u2018should\u2019 or \u2018could\u2019 be, but no one knows it better than you. Please don\u2019t think I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t seek advice, as talking to others is a huge inspiration. But, speaking from very recent experience, sometimes it can be easy to be steered off track or thrown a red herring.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Kate-Berry.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thanks to our friends at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.therefinerysunshinecoast.com\/\">The Refinery<\/a>, we had the chance to chat with one of their 2020 mentors, the brilliant <a href=\"https:\/\/hellokateberry.com\/\">Kate Berry<\/a>.
