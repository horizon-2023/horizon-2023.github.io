So I am really excited to try new things, learn new skills and see what comes of them.<\/p>\n<p>What kind of inspirations go into your work?<br \/>\nThere are so many inspirations and influences that keep pushing my work. As a &#8216;landscape&#8217; (not limited to)&nbsp;artist, being in nature and exploring is a huge inspiration. Northern NSW is where it all started for me as there is no place like it! I also love raves, I find them inspirational and so much fun &#8211; as you will never know what you will see next and what crazy things people come up with. It is where you find some of the best modern art in the world &#8211; deep in a forest somewhere&#8230; My architectural practices and studies have pushed me certainly. I was taught by my previous architectural bosses, if it isn&#8217;t worked out or created by hand then it isn&#8217;t real. Physicality and creating by hand is the real deal. I have been influenced as well by modernist architectural theory of Peter Eisenman and his post functionalism and autonomy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/000030.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"519\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nSadly, I don&#8217;t have a studio so, on the floor of my balcony or bedroom is where I like to create most, you are up close with your work, especially trying to achieve tight lines and edges in my paintings and collages.<\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nThere have been a few; if I had to pick then these would be my top 3.<\/p>\n<p>1: Would have been my first little A5 Wollumbin Collage for my friend Holly! It was taken from Cudgen, along the Tweed River which is one of my favourite spots. I don&#8217;t know why I did it. It was so rough but the composition and colours worked, and so did the idea of hard-edge colourfield landscapes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2. My first art show at Mon_Abris 1.0 where the curators had some strip coloured strobe lights, and by sheer accident transformed the space and the art I was presenting in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3. At &#8216;Bunker&#8217; last year I created a huge 3+m high wall with over 60 hand-cut collages which was also paired with a lightshow. It was my biggest work to date and by far one of the funnest combining so many colours.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/IMG_1341.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/PXL_20201205_034902122.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>To see more of Jack&#8217;s&nbsp;work, head across to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/hell_ripper_boy_jack\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/PXL_20201202_031741085.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Who are you and what do you create?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Jack MacRae (28), Coolum based, Graduate of Architecture, Surfing obsessed.
