Noosa National Park is my go to when I want to take photo references for specific plant species. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nI am connected to all the pieces I create on a personal level, so I guess every piece is quite important to me. When I commence a new painting, I try not to have any real preconceived ideas, I like to go where it takes me, intuitively. &nbsp;This really helps in creating some unique artworks, that no one else or even myself could really produce again, but still have my particular style to them.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To see more of Carley&#8217;s work, head to her <a href=\"https:\/\/www.carleybourne.com\/\">website <\/a>or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/carleybourne\/\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/4_1.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"575\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/2_0.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"571\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Who are you and what do you create?<\/strong><br \/>\nI am an emerging artist living on the Sunshine Coast.\u00a0I finally decided to take a leap of faith and turn a personal hobby of years into a profession and have not looked back since! \u00a0I&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4116,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_editorskit_title_hidden":false,"_editorskit_reading_time":0,"_editorskit_is_block_options_detached":false,"_editorskit_block_options_position":"{}","inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[64],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/638"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=638"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/638\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4115,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/638\/revisions\/4115"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4116"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=638"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=638"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=638"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
