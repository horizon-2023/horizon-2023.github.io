I am a musician, singer\/songwriter, podcast producer and creative arts entrepreneur. Band of Frequencies is my main musical focus, but I also perform solo and collaborate on various projects like \u2018Trace\u2019 that was featured in Horizon Festival 2020 with filmmaker and projection artist James Muller. Since 2019 I have been producing \u2018The Waterpeople Podcast\u2019 with Lauren Hill and Dave Rastovich that is now into season two and has built a dedicated international following.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/1_3.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>What materials and techniques do you use?<br \/>\nIn creating music, I use all manner of sound creating gadgets, both acoustic, analogue and digital. My main instrument is guitar and I have a love of morphing sounds with an array of effects pedals.<\/p>\n<p>What kind of inspirations go into your work?<br \/>\nThe ocean is one of my main creative influences and most ideas come while I\u2019m in or around the sea. I\u2019m also a keen observer of eco systems and human beings with a particular interest in deep time, the evolution of life, human behavioural patterns and what it takes to change collective perceptions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/4.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"511\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nI like to write whilst immersed in nature, camping out or adventuring. I also love creating music with Band of Frequencies on stage, preferably on the beach at dusk like we have many times at Noosa Festival of Surfing and once on the North Shore of Hawaii looking out at second reef Pipeline breaking as we played the soundtrack to life in the backyard of the Billabong House .<\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nThe next work always feels like the most important.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/2_2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1051\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>To see more of Shannon&#8217;s work, head to his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/shannonsolcarroll\/\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Photos:<br \/>\n1.&nbsp;Mount Emu.
