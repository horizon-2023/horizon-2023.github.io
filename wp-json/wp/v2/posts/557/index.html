Even if we come from the desert, the moment we meet the water there is a transformation, and for each of us we are taken somewhere that is only of our own knowing. In this imagery I hope to capture people in that space, so that perhaps we the observers can search out where these subjects have gone and truly see them for the first time.\u201d &#8211; Keith Hamlyn<\/em><\/h3>\n<p><em>I Sea U<\/em> is an existing portrait series diving into peoples&#8217; relationship with the sea, led by Sunshine Coast based photographer Keith Hamlyn. <em>I Sea U<\/em> will partner with Horizon Festival in 2021 to expand and build on the existing foundations of the project. Surfers and ocean-people local to Caloundra (from Currimundi to Golden Beach) will have the opportunity to have their portrait taken in the ocean, capturing their unique connection to the sea. The final exhibition will take place during Horizon Festival 2021 at the boardwalk from Happy Valley to Kings Beach, between 27 Aug &#8211; 5 Sept 2021.<\/p>\n<p>We are calling to the Caloundra community to nominate themselves, or someone else, to participate in <em>I Sea U<\/em>. We are looking for a diverse representation of the local ocean community, which means that not every nomination will be selected for the project.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Nominations for <em>I Sea U<\/em> are now closed.<\/p>\n<h2>MORE INFO<\/h2>\n<p><strong>The Shoot<\/strong><br \/>\nThe shoot is done in the last hour of direct sunlight, and shoots will take place between November &#8211; May. Due to being at the mercy of Mother Nature, shoots may be cancelled at the last minute due to bad weather or lack of light. Shoots generally last 15-30 minutes per individual.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What You Need<\/strong><br \/>\nThe imagery is about simplicity, so bathers need to be as simple as possible with minimal bold patterns. During winter if wetsuits are needed, please avoid wearing items with large brand names or logos. We ask participants to wear minimum to no make-up. Waterproof mascara is ok.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Photos<\/strong><br \/>\nAll images are owned by Keith Hamlyn. Horizon Festival will be granted a license to the images for unrestricted promotional purposes in the lead-up to the 2021 Festival and post-Festival, such as;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social media (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, e-Newsletter)<\/li>\n<li>Print program<\/li>\n<li>Internal and external presentations to partners, stakeholders etc.<\/li>\n<li>Online during the festival.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Participants will be provided one low res portrait at no charge once the project is released.
