I moved back to Queensland six years ago after living and working as a musician for 30 years in Melbourne. It&#8217;s a great community here \u2014 there&#8217;s lots of musicians and artists that live here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And where to you work?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My music work takes me all over the country but as I am visual artist as well I have a studio on Macleay Island .<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Where&#8217;s your favourite place to go on the Sunshine Coast location<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a guest performer for <a aria-label=\"Dawn Awakening (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/event\/dawn-awakening\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Dawn Awakening<\/a> last year it doesn\u2019t get much better than Stumers Creek and Coolum Beach for me. It was such a pleasure to work with Lyndon Davis (and the Gubi Gubi Dance team) and the incredible crew from Horizon festival who are so incredibly supportive of all artists involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Well, thank you! How would you describe yourself as an artist?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a singer songwriter and visual artist. I&#8217;m a Guugu Yimidhirr\/Kaurareg Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. In my wide-ranging career I have worked with many of Australia\u2019s best musicians, starting my career with pioneering Indigenous band \u201cNo Fixed Address\u201d and I was a founding member of the Black Arm Band. I have also remained committed to working in communities for over 40 years. I&#8217;m a singer, songwriter, yidaki player, guitarist, band leader, and recording artist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your work \/ practice to others?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My songwriting and art takes people on a journey across Australia and incorporates often unknown stories of Aboriginal and Islander Australia<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How would those closest to you describe you in one sentence?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think they would say: <em>He is passionate about creating change and understanding&nbsp;through music, as he says, melodically and harmoniously. He is much loved and respected by all who know him.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you had to describe your Horizon Festival project to someone you didn\u2019t know, what would you say?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The show celebrates our Elders. It&#8217;s a glimpse into Queensland\u2019s black history and the achievements of our elders and leaders whose struggle achieved so much for future generations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who will love your project? <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The importance of this show is threefold: to provide Elders and community members an avenue to reminisce \u2014 to reflect on their own lives and achievements despite adversity; to educate young people and children in Indigenous history and the resilience, strength, survival and resistance of Ancestors; and to enable non-Indigenous people an enhanced understanding of historical contexts.&nbsp;The songs tell the stories of strong Elders and leaders who fought to ensure justice for Indigenous peoples.&nbsp;This show is a tribute to them so that they are remembered for their&nbsp;part in the struggle for justice. It is a journey through Blak&nbsp;history through Blak&nbsp;music, is engaging, educational and thought provoking.&nbsp; At a time where the Uluru Statement of the Heart is forefront in Australian minds, this is the time for transformational change. It is a celebration of 40 years in the music industry as an Indigenous activist songwriter and performer. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>What are you looking forward to most about Horizon Festival?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said earlier, I had an amazing experience being part of Horizon Festival last year, so I\u2019m really looking forward to bringing my band, songs, and insight into Blak History to audiences on the Sunshine Coast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Ok, time for some quick-fire questions.<\/strong><\/strong> <strong>One word to describe your show?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Songline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What else will you be doing while you&#8217;re on the Sunshine Coast?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Checking out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/event\/kabi-kabi-connections\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Kabi Kabi Connections (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Kabi Kabi Connections<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Favourite book, band and meal?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Book: Palm Island: Through a long lens<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Band: Earth, Wind and Fire<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meal: Thai curry<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tell us something people don\u2019t know about you<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got a real blakfulla sense of humour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-highlight-color has-text-color\">for more info on Joe, head to his <a href=\"https:\/\/joegeia,com.au\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"website (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">website<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/joegeia_music\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Instagram (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:18px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Joe-Geia_hero2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5897\" srcset=\"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Joe-Geia_hero2-1.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Joe-Geia_hero2-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Joe-Geia_hero2-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Joe-Geia_hero2-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Joe-Geia_hero2-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Joe-Geia_hero2-1-800x450.jpg 800w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Joe-Geia_hero2-1-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Joe-Geia_hero2-1-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-highlight-color has-text-color\"><strong>Searching for more events?
