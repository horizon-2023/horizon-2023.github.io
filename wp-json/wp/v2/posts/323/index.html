About 24 years ago. Ouch.<\/p>\n<p>What materials and techniques do you use?<br \/>\nI combine fragments of light, salty water, and the human form. I then mix them through a glass sieve, let them simmer in a black box, before adding them to a digital oven. Where I then cook them, until they are sharp and crispy, and serve them onto a wall for you to eat.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/StephenDawes_0.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1152\" alt=\"man in the ocean\"><\/p>\n<p>What does a typical day look like for you?<br \/>\nHopefully not anxiety ridden. It has been a very hectic couple of years.&nbsp;I try to start with a bush walk and some meditation, then my day is normally divided between my photography, my vegetable&nbsp;oil business, and I\u2019ll normally throw a bit of mulching in there as well.<\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nBeing in nature has always been my safe space, but I would like to bring some more studio work into my life. It&#8217;s getting to bloody hot outside!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/IMG_0524.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" alt=\"man in a house\"><\/p>\n<p>Outside of photography, what keeps you busy?<br \/>\nI own a vegetable oil business&nbsp;supplying kitchens with fresh oils and collecting the waste, which will be then converted into Bio Diesel. Also, over&nbsp; the past 12-months I&nbsp;have been building a studio and rehabilitating my property that I live on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What Inspirations go into your work?<br \/>\nImmersing myself in nature (surfing is good for that) and observing our kind.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/IMG_0555.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" alt=\"Keith surfing \"><\/p>\n<p>Was there a defining moment in your life that made you think that you were on the right path?<br \/>\nTo be sincere, yes there was. But to say I\u2019ve walked that path since,&nbsp;would be untrue. I was very sick as a teenager and the doorway back to health allowed for some lightbulb moments that definitely set me on a path. But in recent years \u2014&nbsp;well, too many actually \u2014&nbsp;I\u2019ve really struggled with anxiety and depression. I actually had to step away from photography because of it. I did so to work on myself, and my mental health, and amazingly when the fog started to abate I was approached by Horizon Festival to continue&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/event\/i-sea-u\">I Sea U<\/a>&nbsp;and now I\u2019m showing at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/Caloundra\">Caloundra Regional Gallery<\/a>. So,&nbsp;for me&nbsp;it confirmed what I already knew: the path was always under my feet.&nbsp;I just needed to find my grounding&nbsp;to walk it again.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/ISeaU-Mullets.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" alt=\"people in the ocean\"><\/p>\n<p>What makes you happy?<br \/>\nBeing in the presence of sincere humans.<\/p>\n<p>Tell us about your upcoming exhibition \u2018I Sea U\u2019?<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s beautiful, I can tell you that. I\u2019m so grateful to these strangers who gave themselves up to my vision. I feel we all have a deep evolutionary relationship to water, and for me&nbsp;immersing ourselves in the sea is a trigger for that connection. I want to create portraits that allow the viewer to wonder on what the connection and space it takes the subject to. Having the gallery, where a lot of the prints are life-size, will be such a great experience compared to looking at the images on a phone. I\u2019m a combo of excitement and anxiety, but I\u2019m going to make sure excitement wins.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/0757KeithHamlyn1-3-18.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1152\" alt=\"lady in the ocean\"><\/p>\n<p>Got some books to&nbsp;read this year?<\/p>\n<p>Toa Te Ching&nbsp;by Lao Tzu. It&#8217;s a book of wisdom via 81 poems written 2500 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Alchemist&nbsp;by Paulo Coehlo. It&#8217;s&nbsp;always a nice reminder to an underlying beauty in our world.<\/p>\n<p>Dark Emu&nbsp;by Bruce Pascoe. I\u2019d highly recommend this and think that everyone should read it. We have been raised on a lot of lies in this country and&nbsp;it can\u2019t hurt to be open to other possibilities rather than just our colonial ideas of what we call Australia.<\/p>\n<p>What are your favourite 3 albums?<br \/>\nThat&#8217;s hard.<\/p>\n<p>Anything by Tool.<\/p>\n<p>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&nbsp;by&nbsp;Flaming Lips.<\/p>\n<p>Innervisions&nbsp;by&nbsp;Stevie Wonder.<\/p>\n<p>But really 3 ain\u2019t fair.<\/p>\n<p>Favourite water person?<br \/>\nDave Rastovich<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/ISeaU-Gurdeep.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" alt=\"man in the ocean\"><\/p>\n<p>What three artists are exciting you most on the Sunshine Coast?<br \/>\nHard question because there is amazing depth on the coast.<\/p>\n<p>I love Ruby Donohoe\u2019s art as it&#8217;s completely embodied in her. So grateful that&nbsp;Horizon made me aware of her.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Big love for Alison Mooney. Her work just makes me smile&nbsp;and I love that I know it\u2019s her, before I know it\u2019s her work, if you know what I mean?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;I also love&nbsp;Georgina Hooper. She&#8217;s extremely talented. Georgina&#8217;s very focused on her Doctorate of Philosophy presently but can\u2019t wait to see what she produces in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Favourite food?<br \/>\nIt\u2019s not great for me but I bloody love Lasagne.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ok then. First date: what you cooking?<br \/>\nGoing tacos. Simple, you have dietary options and if it tastes bad it\u2019s not really your fault.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/ISeaU_Shaun-Keith-Hamlyn.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" alt=\"man in the ocean\"><\/p>\n<p>Finally, what\u2019s next for Keith Hamlyn?<br \/>\nI have a few projects I\u2019d like to embark on, but I\u2019d most&nbsp;like to pick up a series I began, before my mental health holiday, which I call, Bloodlines. It\u2019s a combo of an interview and a photoshoot with fathers of fathers. I want to know about the experience of fatherhood and how that&nbsp;changes them as a man and as a son or a father. I then pair images together where the father and son have similar expressions. I\u2019m pretty excited by it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Yann-Combo.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"460\" alt=\"Bloodlines\"><\/p>\n<h3>To see more of Keith&#8217;s work, head across to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/keithhamlyn_photo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/keithhamlyn.com\/\">website<\/a>, or check out his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/event\/i-sea-u\">exhibition<\/a> as part of Horizon Festival.<\/h3>\n<p>Image credits in order of appearance:<br \/>\nPortrait of Keith Hamlyn<br \/>\nI Sea U \u2014 Stephen<br \/>\nKeith sat down reading<br \/>\nI Sea U \u2014 Mullets<br \/>\nI Sea U \u2014 Alana<br \/>\nI Sea U \u2014 Gurdeep<br \/>\nI Sea U \u2014 Shaun<br \/>\nBloodlines&nbsp;by Keith Hamlyn<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Who are you and what do you create?<\/strong><br \/>\nMy name is Keith Hamlyn and\u00a0I\u2019m a multidimensional being of light who uses two dimensions of the same form to stop moments for eternity and prosperity, whatever that might be.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3894,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_editorskit_title_hidden":false,"_editorskit_reading_time":0,"_editorskit_is_block_options_detached":false,"_editorskit_block_options_position":"{}","inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[64],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/323"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=323"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/323\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3893,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/323\/revisions\/3893"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3894"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=323"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=323"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=323"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
