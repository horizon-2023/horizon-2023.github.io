All of my works are hand painted and each design is one of a kind.&nbsp;\u200bGrowing up I was always so inspired by one of a kind pieces. I felt there was something magical about owning something that nobody else has. There may be similarities in each piece and they go together well, but each piece has its own originality. I think that&#8217;s how I like to see people too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/profile.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"705\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>What kind of inspirations go into your work?<br \/>\nMy pieces are inspired by the joys of sharing. I think that&#8217;s why I enjoy making dinnerware the most and small items that can easily be bought and gifted to friends. &nbsp;My current range of ceramics is inspired by the ocean, the earth, the sky and muddy bush walks. They remind me of my childhood growing up on the Sunshine Coast. We would go to the beach every afternoon after school, even if it was raining to walk the dog and collect shells. Mum would pick us up from school with rain coats and umbrellas. The school, our home and the beach were within walking distance from each other within a triangle. Thats why you can often see triangles in my pieces. You can also find Native American symbolism present in my works as my ancestors are Navajo.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Mudita-ceramics_september-28-2019_daniel-hine-sunshine-coast-product-photographer_037.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1152\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nI like to create in my studio and sometimes I go to the beach to create pinch pots as I get a lot of my inspiration from nature.&nbsp;I sometimes like to work alone but most of the time I love creating with other people around me. I like to chat while I make and I listen to a lot of music in the studio.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Mudita-ceramics_september-28-2019_daniel-hine-sunshine-coast-product-photographer_008_low-res.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1152\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nMy favourite piece to date would have to be a little all seeing eye incense holder that actually just came out of the kiln yesterday! I was in a really relaxed mind state when I made it and it feels very personal to me. I love the colours though so I&#8217;ll definitely be making more of them to sell!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I just launched my online store last week&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/protect-au.mimecast.com\/s\/lpRRC5QPMjIwqxsjQoG4?domain=muditaceramics.com\">www.muditaceramics.com<\/a>&nbsp;after months of working on it. I wanted to do it myself so that it had the essence of why I create my ceramics. It has been a long journey but I am really happy with the result.&nbsp;I hope you like my ceramics!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Mudita-ceramics_september-28-2019_daniel-hine-sunshine-coast-product-photographer_035.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Who are you and what do you create?<\/strong><br \/>\nI am Bree-anne Jeffrey from Mudit\u0101 Ceramics and I create hand built and hand painted dinnerware, homewares and jewellery in sustainable small batches.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>What materials and<\/strong>&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4235,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_editorskit_title_hidden":false,"_editorskit_reading_time":0,"_editorskit_is_block_options_detached":false,"_editorskit_block_options_position":"{}","inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[64],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/796"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=796"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/796\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4234,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/796\/revisions\/4234"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4235"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=796"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=796"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=796"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
