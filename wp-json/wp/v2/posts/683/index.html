From Hyperrealism through to multi coloured portraits and ones created entirely of traditional style dots..&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What kind of inspirations go into your work?<br \/>\nA lot of my inspiration is derived via the muti faceted expression of the human spirit.. I am very passionately drawn to the stories that reflect the triumph, the innocence, the unbridled expression of the human spirit. Especially when it comes to &nbsp;the liberation or emancipation of the human spirit from circumstances that normally serve to oppress or drain the life from it..&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/1_0.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nI like to create most of my works in a studio space. With headphones on and absolutely no distractions around so I can completely surrender and loose myself. At one with the process..&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nMy favourite piece of my collection to date is a painting titled \u2018Seasons\u2019 and it shows within a multi coloured portrait a son sitting on his fathers shoulders. It represents a natural sacred reverence for &nbsp;for the sustainable cycle of life. As that same boy that is carried now, will be one day carrying his father. Honouring the seasons and cycles of life the we all go through and are part of..&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My most important work I feel is possibly one titled \u2018Walking Together\u2019 and it is a First Nation bout holding and guiding the hand of a non First Nations boy. Representing walking together proper way.. As there is a learning or what has been here on this land for over 2000 generations.. And the culture that sustained it.<\/p>\n<p>To see more of Jandamarra&#8217;s work, head to his <a href=\"http:\/\/jandamarrasart.com\/\">website <\/a>or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jandamarrasart\/\">Instagram<\/a>.
