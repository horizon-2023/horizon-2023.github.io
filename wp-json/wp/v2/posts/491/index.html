I keep Moleskine&#8217;s full of notes I have written in nature, including poems, drawings, connections and observations. These notes become a direct gateway to the beginning of an artwork.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/RESIZED_Evelyn_Marina_Paolino_8_Woman_Of_Art.png\" width=\"768\" height=\"960\" alt=\"Woman sits in artist studio surrounded by paintings, paints and brushes.\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Evelyn_Marina_Paolino_7_Woman_Of_Art.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" alt=\"Image of gallery with surfboards lined along the right hand side and two bllue ink based artworks hung on the wall.\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/RESIZED-Evelyn_Marina_Paolino_6.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1086\" alt=\"Ink painting of a table, with two vases of flowers and an artwork hung on the wall.\"><\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nI like to create within a space which is filled with all my favourite things; tools, books, plants, music and sun. This space isn&#8217;t any sole place, I&#8217;m creating wherever feels like home.&nbsp;&nbsp;.<\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nIn September of this year, I started an initiative called \u2018Notes for Friends\u2019.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I premised this project broadly, I wanted people to feel comfortable doing this for themselves or nominating their friends. All they knew was that they were getting free artwork with a poem on the back. But it was more than that, it was something to look forward to and cherish deeply.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;Creating these works was fulfilling and creative, I produced over 45 original works \u2014 no two artworks the same because no two people are the same.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;I was inundated with individuals speaking positively of this project, I was able to reconnect with people, I listened, and most importantly gave what I have to offer. Art, love and that warm feeling I&#8217;m searching for.
