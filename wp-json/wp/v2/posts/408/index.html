Generally, I facilitate shoots by creating safe spaces for people to be themselves \u2014 whatever that may mean to them. My role as a photographer is to ask the right questions, listen, and to capture that process.<\/p>\n<p>What kind of inspirations go into your work?<br \/>\nBesides having creative influences, I take most of my inspiration from the people I\u2019m working with and places I shoot in. By leaving room for a\u00a0sense of improvisation and play on shoots, I aim to be able to capture something true to the time and place.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/2020_Keziah-Gall.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Keziah Gall\" width=\"768\" height=\"513\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/2020-June-6_BLM_Brisbane_upload-9395.jpg\" alt=\"Black and white photo a group of performers with the sun radiating through\" width=\"768\" height=\"513\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/2020-Tasmin.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of a lady in her underwear wearing gloves\" width=\"768\" height=\"1151\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nI don\u2019t have a specific place I like to create in per se, but I do find myself drawn to natural locations a lot of the time. One of my favourite things to do is to go hiking somewhere new with my camera and respond to places I find with self-portraits. It also helps to keep location scouting fun. My home studio is also somewhere I love to create in. I set up in my lounge room and invite friends around to test out different concepts.<\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nThis is hard to define as so many of my works have been stepping stones with no real defining moment.\u00a0But if I had to, I\u2019d say my self-portraits for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au\/Experience-Sunshine-Coast\/Arts-and-Culture\/Arts-programs-and-initiatives\/Creative-spaces-in-residence\/Warwick-Gow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creative Spaces (in Residence)<\/a> during the COVID-19 lockdown of 2020. It was the first time I\u2019d really published my self-portrait works, especially something so vulnerable. The response to those pieces has definitely encouraged me to explore that side of my practice more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/2020-CSIsoResi_WarwickGow_Day3.jpg\" alt=\"Self-portrait of photographer, Warwick Gow, lying on the ground\" width=\"768\" height=\"513\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/2020-CSIsoResi_WarwickGow_Day5_0.jpg\" alt=\"Photographer, Warwick Gow, stood naked on a table\" width=\"768\" height=\"513\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To see more of Warwick&#8217;s work, head across to his\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/warwickgowphoto\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/upload-0679.jpg\" alt=\"A lady with blue hair holding two lighters in front of her eye\" width=\"768\" height=\"1151\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/upload-3-3.jpg\" alt=\"A lady with a shaved head with stickers on her body and face\" width=\"768\" height=\"1086\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Who are you and what do you create?<\/strong><br \/>\nMy name is Warwick Gow, and I&#8217;m a portrait photographer based out of the Sunshine Coast.
