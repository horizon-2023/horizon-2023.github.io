I mostly paint portraits and figures in oil paints.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Portrait2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>What materials and techniques do you use?<br \/>\nI use a technique called Alla Prima which translates too wet on wet. Majority of the painting is done in the first sitting, so you have to be somewhat precise with your brush strokes, the outcome is more textural and impressionistic which i find interesting. Although I do sometimes find myself going back to a painting again and again for months or years until it feels like it&#8217;s complete, Its a skill in itself (that I&#8217;m still learning) to know when to put the brush down and be content. I also really enjoy working with charcoal and pastels. It feels very freeing to me and it&#8217;s easy to quickly express yourself with.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What kind of inspirations go into your work?<br \/>\nI would say one of my biggest influences would be the rennaisance period, the compositions and anatomical detail have always captured me, and being able to translate the subtleties of the human experience through well placed shadows and shapes have become a large goal for me. There is always so much to be learnt by the old masters.&nbsp;It truly inspires me seeing someone else enjoy what you have created. The vulnerability that comes with showing your work, but also the joy. The intelLectual challenge and commitment, its a beautiful experience. It all keeps me coming back for more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot_20191218-164202_Instagram.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"779\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nRight now my studio is set up in my living room, I get nice natural light and a sea breeze there. But I dream of a big airy warehouse studio on the coast, where i can really expand my work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nI&#8217;m not sure if I have a favourite, but i do have a few pieces that I&#8217;m kind of attached too and cant bring myself to sell or rehome.&nbsp;My most important piece would have to be the portrait of Jim for an art show I was involved in at The Pocket Espresso Bar earlier in the year. Jim, is a Moffat beach local and is very well known by the Moffat community. I had a overwhelming amout of support from the event, and being my first showing ever, the paintings and the art show in general are really special to me.<\/p>\n<p>To see more of Ebony&#8217;s work, head to her <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ebonybusk_art\/\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot_20191218-180757_Instagram.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"763\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Jim2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot_20191218-164543_Instagram.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"963\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Who are you and what do you create?<\/strong><br \/>\nMy name is Ebony Busk, a self taught artist based in Caloundra.
