As far as technique goes, it\u2019s also a range of different ways to produce the artworks that I have been refining for the last 20&nbsp;years.<\/p>\n<p>What kind of inspirations go into your work?<br \/>\nFrom a young age I have been fascinated with both graffiti and signage. The old hand painted signage is something that has continued to inform my creative process now since I was a teenager, and adding graffiti into the mix has helped to create a unique combination of the two. I travel the world extensively each year as well, so the difference in scenery and colours is something that is deeply entrenched in my work. I am&nbsp;particularly drawn to the pastels of the desert and the coast.<\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nI think the greatest&nbsp;space for any artist is in the public sphere. I like to create pieces that are incongruous at times, and harmonious at others, but ultimately in the public sphere is my favourite place. I like to shock or soothe, either is a welcome chance to spark something in the mind of the observer.<\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nHard to say, to be honest. They all mark a certain time, and a certain mood. I feel like they age well for the public, but for me I would be happy to be allowed to cover them every six months with something new.<\/p>\n<p>To see more of Joel&#8217;s work, head to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/joeldtd\/\">Instagram&nbsp;<\/a>or&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.joelfcbirch.com\/\">website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Joel-Birch-1.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Joel-Birch-5.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Joel-Birch-3.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Joel-Birch-6.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Joel-Birch-4.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Who are you and what do you create?<\/strong><br \/>\nMy name is Joel Birch, I am a multidisciplinary artist from the Sunshine\u00a0Coast, creating type based illustrations, large scale murals,\u00a0photographs, and writing the lyrics for the band\u00a0I\u00a0&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4098,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_editorskit_title_hidden":false,"_editorskit_reading_time":0,"_editorskit_is_block_options_detached":false,"_editorskit_block_options_position":"{}","inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[64],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/610"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=610"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/610\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4097,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/610\/revisions\/4097"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4098"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=610"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=610"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=610"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
