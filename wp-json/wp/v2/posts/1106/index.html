What have you been up to today?<\/strong><br \/>\nHey! Well I woke up, meditated, went for a stroll through the luscious streets of Buderim and now it appears I\u2019m here doing an interview<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/C017270-R1-29-71_0-3.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"514\" alt=\"man in the garden\"><\/p>\n<p>Tell us a little bit about yourself? What\u2019s your (short) story?<br \/>\nI\u2019m born and bred on the Sunshine coast. Having been brought up so close to the beachfront of Alexandra Headlands, I\u2019ve always had an affinity with the ocean ever since I can remember. I was born into a family of surfers and musicians, so have always greatly appreciated and felt a sense of solidarity within both disciplines. I can\u2019t quite place myself in either of these categories though. I more so consider myself an artist, explorer, lover of nature\/things of the world\u2026 a traditional romantic, mind the antiquated tropes and language-ings.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/2D-1-2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1086\" alt=\"collage\"><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m keen to hear how you landed on the coast?<br \/>\nI landed up here from Melbourne about 5\u20136 months ago after quite a depressed and thorough series of lockdowns. I moved down there early in my adolescence with my twin brother Alex and another dear friend of ours. Between meeting my lovely partner, Lucy, in Melbourne and completing my Advanced Diploma of Visual Art I decided it was about time to ditch the city life for a small town and breathe some fresh air into my life. The sea was calling me strongly, so I chose to roam back up here.<\/p>\n<p>You work closely with your brother, Alex, through&nbsp;Colossus Records \u2014 have you guys always been close?<br \/>\nYeah definitely. We\u2019ve been pretty close ever since bonding in our mother\u2019s womb!&nbsp;Colossus&nbsp;is the primary platform which we collaborate through, presently, but have always complimented each other\u2019s creative endeavours. Whether that be developing artwork\/visual concepts for his band,&nbsp;Red Entries&nbsp;or vice versa collaborating on soundscapes to aide my installation practice. He\u2019s been a constant creative companion and source of inspiration in my life.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/images-for-meditation02-2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1086\" alt=\"painting\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/IMG_2811-2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"516\" alt=\"man in a studio\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chairs2-2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1086\" alt=\"painting\"><\/p>\n<p>It must be special to work closely with each other \u2014 especially during a time where people have been so distant from their loved ones. What are the moments you enjoy most, working with each other?<br \/>\nIt\u2019s a privilege to have someone in this life that provides an extension of creative interest. Some of the standout moments are hard to define, but I would say it\u2019s overall a positive, expansive experience discussing and getting excited about possible avenues and creative directions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/PEACE-2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1086\" alt=\"painting\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/starz-print2-2.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1086\" alt=\"painting\"><\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s the deal with Colossus Records? How was it born?<br \/>\nColossus was formed by Alex close to the end of 2018 as an independent record label primarily operating on the Sunshine Coast. Aiden Baxter, Pete JVR, Michael Ufer and I followed closely after. We started branching into the Brisbane scene early to mid 2019 doing frequent shows mostly orbiting around Alex and Michaels band at the time Red Entries. At the moment, we\u2019re starting to do national gigs \u2014 our first Melbourne gig happened at the end of last month \u2014 and we\u2019ve got plenty more in the works, yeeehaw!<\/p>\n<p>Are there any gigs, or releases, coming up that we can look forward to?<br \/>\nWell I\u2019m not meant to share specifics, but I\u2019ll say that we\u2019re currently planning something big for Colossus\u2019s 4th birthday in August, so stay tuned for that. Also in the works is a Colossus collective \u2014 we\u2019re branching out into the art scene and providing emerging artists with a platform to voice their work and define the meaningful concepts orbiting their practice that otherwise would be shrouded by commercial models of promotion.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/colossus-1.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"963\" alt=\"poster\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/colossus2-1.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1180\" alt=\"portrait of a group\"><\/p>\n<p>Image:&nbsp;Jacob McCann<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s your favourite music venue on the coast?<br \/>\nAll my favourite venues have shifted down towards Brisbane these days! Probably Solbar if I had to choose one. I\u2019m a big fan of the community specific environment. Eleven Dive Bar is another place to keep your eye on in the local scene.<\/p>\n<p>Having spent some time in Melbourne and Brisbane, what do you find charming about the Sunshine Coast \u2014 from both a lifestyle and music point of view?<br \/>\nWell I feel like I\u2019m viewing it from a completely different perspective now that I\u2019m back up here! Contrasting the city environment, I have a much more profound appreciation for the land. The music\/art scene has a space and penetrability that I really love and find exciting, especially as an emerging creator.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/IMG_3622-1.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"509\" alt=\"portrait\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/IMGP3305-1.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"509\" alt=\"people in the street\"><\/p>\n<p>I really love your collage work. Is this something you have always been into?<br \/>\nThanks! Collage was the primary medium I was drawn to when I considered starting a serious independent arts practice. I think I\u2019m very interested in the idea of layering media and how you can communicate contrasting sense impressions through the interpolation of multiple mediums. I can still see early motifs and collagical symbols trickle into the work I do today.<\/p>\n<p>How has your work evolved over the years?<br \/>\nIt\u2019s an interesting question because the work has no grounding or stability without the guiding concept or intent behind it. My ideologies, values, and way I navigate the world can greatly alter over the course of a year. Therefore, the impetus of the work is forever in a state of flux. This is something I welcome and recognise as a characteristic of practice. A recurring notion prevalent in my practice, at present, is understanding art as a means for societal unification and personal self-discovery \u2014 which is my lived experience of art as well. This has the potential to shift as my understanding of art and arts practice moves in different directions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BLOOM-2-1.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"960\" alt=\"collage\"><\/p>\n<p>What inspires your work and how important is having a theme to it?<br \/>\nMy work is inspired by the environment I live and the things I surround myself with! Some figures that really inspire my work are people like Carolee Schneeman, Roni Horn and Jefferey Cheung \u2014 and movements like Situationism and also Surrealism in a broad sense. I don\u2019t think having a theme is necessary at all because the work is coloured by our life experiences and circumstances. So, when another is engaging with my work they\u2019re also engaging with my reality.<\/p>\n<p>Onto less work-related things: how do you like to spend your free days?<br \/>\nMy free time is dedicated to my meditation practice and exploring the beautiful lands of the Sunshine Coast \u2014 going for hikes, surfing, and free diving, etc. Also, I think it\u2019s really sustaining for me to connect to diverse communities of people up here, which I\u2019ve been trying to do as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/carcrash2-1.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1086\" alt=\"painting\"><\/p>\n<p>Was there a defining moment in your life that made you think that you were on the right path?<br \/>\nYes! It was when I moved down the Gold Coast for a period in my life studying International Business, of all things. I was going to a private art school and painting in my spare time while studying down there. Eventually painting started consuming more and more of my study time until I realised \u201cwell painting seems really natural and fun for me\u201d and fully shifted my attention to my art. I moved back home and have been increasingly interested in making art ever since.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/invisible-shoelaces-original2-1.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1086\" alt=\"painting\"><\/p>\n<p>What three artists are exciting you most on the coast right now?<br \/>\nIn no particular order and among many others!<\/p>\n<p>Ruby Donohoe<br \/>\nKyle Dobie<br \/>\nWarwick Gow<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/IMG_2818-1.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1143\" alt=\"man in a studio\"><\/p>\n<p>Finally, what\u2019s next for Bryce Flaskas?<br \/>\nI\u2019m planning to go back to studying next year but for the time being I\u2019ll be focusing on developing, and forming, a Colossus Artist Collective; expanding the installation based and the performatively informed aspect of my practice; and narrowing down on some curatorial work I\u2019m currently involved with!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chalisss-202203-copy2-1.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1086\" alt=\"painting\"><\/p>\n<p>To see more of Bryce&#8217;s&nbsp;work, head over to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bryce.flaskas\/\">Instagram<\/a>&nbsp;or check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/colossusrecords\/\">Colossus Records<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><span><strong>Morning mate.
