Alongside this I also love working with cyanotypes, and film photography, creating works inspired by plants, nature and feeling.<\/p>\n<p>What kind of inspirations go into your work?<br \/>\nThe environment, nature and people are major inspirations for my work. I like to explore the current state of the environment focusing on how we interact with it and how it can affect us. The environment plays such a large part in everyday life and sometimes it can go overlooked, through my photography I aim to create or reignite a connection between people and their surroundings. People are also a major inspiration, not only in relation to the environment and that relationship but also focusing on memories, dreams and form.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/profile-photo.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1152\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>In what space do you like to create most?<br \/>\nI enjoy creating outside. Being able to interact with the environment and respond to the surroundings, working with the natural light. It always makes for a different experience every time I\u2019m creating.<\/p>\n<p>What has been your favourite or most important work to date?<br \/>\nMy favourite work to date is probably also my most important, my latest series created for my Honours year at university titled Momentaneum Visum. This series explores the Anthropocene, the proposed age in which humans have had the greatest impact on the environment, exploring a personal representation and disrupted view of landscapes within the Sunshine Coast. It examines human intervention and reflection through the merging the two elements with the landscape to create both a personal and environmental reflection in the viewer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Interaction_lowres.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/projected-memories_lowres.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1152\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>To see more of Rose&#8217;s&nbsp;work, head across to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/rosehocking\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.horizonfestival.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Bound-By-Convenience_lowres.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Who are you and what do you create?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My name is Rose Hocking, and I create environmental and human centred photographs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3995,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_editorskit_title_hidden":false,"_editorskit_reading_time":0,"_editorskit_is_block_options_detached":false,"_editorskit_block_options_position":"{}","inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[64],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/465"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=465"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/465\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3994,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/465\/revisions\/3994"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3995"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=465"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=465"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizon-festival-wp.lndo.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=465"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
